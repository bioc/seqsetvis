#seqsetvis 1.9.11

* new feature - centerGrangesAtMax function for creating query GRanges centered
at. signal maximum.

#seqsetvis 1.9.10

* new feature - easyLoad_seacr function for loading seacr output bed files.
* bugfix ssvFetchBamPE can handle ranges with no reads.

# seqsetvis 1.9.9

*bugfix - levels of unique_names was not being used in ssvFetch functions

# seqsetvis 1.9.5

* bugfix - for stranded bam fetch, strand sensititvity lost when overlapping
features have opposing strands.
* improvement - error if qgr has duplicate names/ids

# seqsetvis 1.9.4

* bugfix - n_region_splits limited to length of qgr

# seqsetvis 1.9.3

* new feature - improved parallelization by splitting up regions according to n_region_splits
* improvement - fragLen for bam file is now calculatd once per bam file prior to any region splitting.
* bugfix - stranded qgr and odd win_size causes inconsistent x values
* bugfix - ssvFetch* - file_paths and file_attribs as data.table causes error.

# seqsetvis 1.7.6

* improvement - added show_cluster_bars arg to ssvSignalHeatmap to suppress cluster labelling.
* improvement - added force_append arg to appen_ynorm to conveinently overwrite previous normalization,

# seqsetvis 1.7.5

* bugfix - update ssvSignalHeatmap for within_order_strategy compatibility
* change - default within_order_strategy is now "sort"

# seqsetvis 1.7.4

* bugfix - error if uniq_names factor

# seqsetvis 1.7.2

* fix - ssvSignalClustering - within cluster sorting was not being applied
* new feature - added within_order_strategy = c("hclust", "sort") paramter to ssvSignalClustering.

# seqsetvis 1.5.3

* new feature - added skip_force_centerFix to all ssvFetch functions to accomodate
retrieval of variable width regions using sample methods, i.e. exons.
* new feature - added collapse_gr() and convert_collapsed_coord() functions to
support maniulation of signal across exons.
* getReadLength is now exported

# seqsetvis 1.5.2

* improvement - ssvFetchGRanges does more than coverage now and can retrieve a qualititative attribute from supplied GRanges.  Support for summary too.  These changes are ideal for chromHMM states or similar.
* improvement - added do_not_cap to append_ynorm to prevent capping at 1.
* bugfix - ssvFetchSignal handle empty result.
* bugfix - better seqlengths handling for fetchBam
* FEATURE viewGrangesWin*_dt now handles qualitative attribute fields via attrib_name parameter.  Default behavior unchanged.

# seqsetvis 1.5.1

* FEATURE added calc_norm_factors and append_y_norm to facilitate normalization
between datasets.
* bugfix - apparent change in how names are used for which parameter of
rtracklayer::import.bw required tweak in ssvFetchBam.single

# seqsetvis 1.3.13

* FEATURE added ssvFetchBamPE to properly handle paired-end (PE) ChIP-seq and
similar data.  In contrast to ssvFetchBamPE read pairs in windows are
identified and entire span of pair (instead of alignment location) is used for
covereage calculation.
* bugfix ssvFetchBam - fixed issue where PE data caused crash.
* improvemnet - fragLen_calcStranded added flip_strand parameter to allow
swapping of strand prior to strand cross correlation.
* bugfix/cleanup in automatic sample naming, unlikely to affect anyone.

# seqsetvis 1.3.8

* coding practice fixes

# seqsetvis 1.3.7

* bam indexes are generated automatically
* added flip_strand param to ssvFetchBam
* bugfix/improvement ssvFetchBam passes ... args to ScanBamParam

# seqsetvis 1.3.6

* change - when strands of qgr are negative, strands of results are
swapped. x coordinates are already flipped.

# seqsetvis 1.3.5

* bugfix/improvement - checks were timing out due to fragLen_calcStranded()
poor performance.  switched to shiftApply on Rle strategy to speed up.
* FEATURE - ssvFetch accepts data.frame/table for file_paths
(character still fine) to efficiently set additional attribues like metadata.
* docs up to passing checks
* FEATURE - ssvFetch* accept n_cores or uses option("mc.cores") to in
parallel.
* FEATURE - ssvFetchGRanges - retreives coverage of a list of GRanges in
form parallel to existing ssvFetch*.

# seqsetvis 1.1.7

* minor documenation improvement

# seqsetvis 1.1.6

* ssvFeature* and ssvSignal* added return_data paramter to skip plotting and
return data used.
* ssvFetchBam added target_strand = "both" support

# seqsetvis 1.1.5

* ssvBamFetch - added max_dupes parameter, default is Inf and shouldn't change
behavior. uses .rm_dupes() internally.
* bugfix: shift_anchor was causing a 1bp shift per call.
* bugfix: ssvBamFetch, strand of qgr and target_strand interacted incorrectly and
led to empty results for mismatches.

# seqsetvis 1.1.4

* ssvBamFetch - added splice_strategy parameter to control split reads for RNA-
seq data.  Defaults is "none" and shouldn't change behavior.
Uses .expand_cigar_dt() internally.

# seqsetvis 1.1.3

* BiocManager added to suggests and vignette.

# seqsetvis 1.1.2

* bugfix: viewGrangesWinSample/Summary_dt were both erroring when 0 reads were in window.
* bugfix: ggplot2 2.3.0 compatibility fix in ssvSignalLinePlotAgg()
* bugfix: col2hex now properly preserves character vector names
* bugfix: ssvFetch now properly allows NA for fragLens to disable fragment extension
* bugfix: ggellipse line_scale and color_scale were being ignored
