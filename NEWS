# setsetvis 0.99.10

* fewer and smaller vignette figures
* ggellipse exported with documentation
* ssvSignalHeatmap calcs better xticks
* ssvFeatureBinaryHeatmap true_color and false_color params addedto allow color control
* ssvFeatureVenn and Euler params unified
* ssvFeatureBars has bar_color param like that of venn and euler

# seqsetvis 0.99.9

* vigentte - some plots reduced in size and dpi reduced to save space.
* ssvFeatureVenn and Euler refactored to use common internal ggellipse function for
consistency.
* ssvBinarizeHeatmap cleaned up plot output and changed default to
raster_approximation = FALSE

# seqsetvis 0.99.8

* fetch* now automatically calculate and apply a fixed width.
* BiocFileCache used for all URL resources in vignette
* vigentte uses cases for CTCF peak overlap and for chromHMM states complete

# seqsetvis 0.99.7

* fixed examples error for ssvSignalLineplot
* addressed BioC notes for seq_len instead of 1:x
* addressed BioC notes for vapply instead of sapply

# seqsetvis 0.99.5

* added easyLoad_narrowPeak() and easyLoad_broadPeak()
* added ssvFactorizeMembTable() for converting membership table to factor
* added movingAverage() from r cookbook
* rename ssvSignalTrackplot to ssvSignalLineplot
* rename bw_dt param to bw_data in all ssvSignal* functions to reflect increased
argument flexibility (GRanges or data.table accepted).
* expanded vignette to include more thorough overview, overview finished but need
use cases.

minor changes

* renamed vignette to seqsetvis_overview.Rmd

# seqsetvis 0.99.4

* rename overlapIntervalSets to ssvOverlapIntervalSets
* improved documentation for CTCF datasets used by vignette
* expanded vignette to include more thorough overview, work in progress.

minor changes

* added show_counts param to ssvFeatureBars

# seqsetvis 0.99.3

* all fetch functions that previously returned data.table now return GRanges by default
* all functions that accepted data.table now also accept GRanges and return the matching class where appropriate
* magrittr pipes removed from all package code and magrittr moved to suggests from imports
* misc minor changes to address reviewer comments (message instead of print, stopifnot to verify inputs, etc.)

# seqsetvis 0.99.2

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
