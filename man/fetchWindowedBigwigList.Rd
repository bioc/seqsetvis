\title{Iterates a character vector (ideally named) and calls \code{fetchWindowedBigwig}
on each.  Appends grouping variable to each resulting data.table and uses rbindlist to
efficiently combine results}
\usage{
fetchWindowedBigwigList(bw_files, qgr, bw_names = names(bw_files),
  bw_variable_name = "sample", win_size = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{bw_files}{The character vector paths to bigwig files to read from.}

\item{qgr}{Set of GRanges to query.  For valid results the width of each
interval should be identical and evenly divisible by \code{win_size}.}

\item{bw_names}{names to use in final data.table to designate source bigwig}

\item{bw_variable_name}{The column name where bw_names are stored.
Default is "sample"}

\item{win_size}{The window size that evenly divides widths in \code{qgr}.}
}
\value{
A tidy formatted data.table containing fetched values.
}
\description{
\code{fetchWindowedBigwigList} iteratively calls \code{fetchWindowedBigwig}.
See \code{\link{fetchWindowedBigwig}} for more info.
}
\details{
if \code{qgr} contains the range chr1:1-100 and \code{win_size} is
10, values from positions chr1 5,15,25...85, and 95 will be retrieved from \code{bw_file}
