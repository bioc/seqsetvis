\title{copy_clust_info}
\usage{
copy_clust_info(target, to_copy, row_ = "id", cluster_ = "cluster_id")
}
\arguments{
\item{target}{A data.table or GRanges returned from ssvFetch*, the target to
which cluster info will be added.}

\item{to_copy}{A data.table or GRanges returned from ssvSignalClustering,
from which to copy cluster if.}

\item{row_}{variable name mapped to row, likely id or gene name for ngs data.
Default is "id" and works with ssvFetch* output.}

\item{cluster_}{variable name to use for cluster info. Default is
"cluster_id".}
}
\value{
data.table or GRanges (whichever target is) containing row order and
  cluster assignment derived from to_copy. Suitable for ssvSignalHeatmap and
  related functions.
