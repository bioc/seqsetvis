\alias{ssvFeatureBinaryHeatmap}
\title{binary heatmap indicating membership.
heatmap is sorted by column left to right.
change column order to reveal patterns}
\usage{
ssvFeatureBinaryHeatmap(object, raster_approximation = TRUE,
  raster_width_min = 1000, raster_height_min = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{passed to ssvMakeMembTable}

\item{raster_approximation}{instead of standard plot, write temporary raster
image and redraw that as plot background.}

\item{raster_width_min}{raster width will be minimun multiple of number of
columns over this number}

\item{raster_height_min}{raster height will be minimun multiple of number of
rows over this number}
}
\value{
ggplot using geom_tile of membership table sorted from left to right.
}
