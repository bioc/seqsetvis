centerAtMax             centers profile of x and y.  default is to
                        center by region but across all samples.
centerFixedSizeGRanges
                        Transforms set of GRanges to all have the same
                        size.
clusteringKmeans        perform kmeans clustering on matrix rows and
                        return reordered matrix along with order
                        matched cluster assignments clusters are sorted
                        using hclust on centers
clusteringKmeansNestedHclust
                        perform kmeans clustering on matrix rows and
                        return reordered matrix along with order
                        matched cluster assignments clusters are sorted
                        using hclust on centers the contents of each
                        cluster are sorted using hclust
col2hex                 converts a valid r color name ("black", "red",
                        "white", etc.) to a hex value
fetchWindowedBigwig     Fetch values from a bigwig appropriate for
                        heatmaps etc.
fetchWindowedBigwigList
                        Iterates a character vector (ideally named) and
                        calls 'fetchWindowedBigwig' on each.  Appends
                        grouping variable to each resulting data.table
                        and uses rbindlist to efficiently combine
                        results
overlapIntervalSets     Intersect a list of GRanges to create a single
                        GRanges object of merged ranges including
                        metadata describing overlaps per input GRanges
regionSetPlotBandedQuantiles
                        plot profiles from bigwigs
regionSetPlotHeatmap    heatmap
regionSetPlotScatter    maps signal from 2 sample profiles to the x and
                        y axis. axes are standard or "volcano" min XY
                        vs fold-change Y/X
