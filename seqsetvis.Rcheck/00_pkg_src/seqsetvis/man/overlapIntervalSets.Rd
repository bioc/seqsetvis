\title{Intersect a list of GRanges to create a single GRanges object of
merged ranges including metadata describing overlaps per input GRanges}

}
\arguments{
\item{grs}{A list of Granges}

\item{ext}{An integ}

\item{use_first}{A logical.  If True, instead of merging all grs, only use
first}
}
\value{
GRanges with metadata columns describing overlap overlap of input grs
