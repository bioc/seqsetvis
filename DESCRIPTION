Description: seqsetvis enables the visualization and analysis of sets of 
    genomic sites in next gen sequencing data. 
    Although seqsetvis was designed for the comparison of 
    mulitple ChIP-seq samples, this package is domain-agnostic and allows the 
    processing of multiple genomic coordinate files (bed-like files) and 
    signal files (bigwig files pileups from bam file).
