Description: Makes the visual analysis of ChIP-seq peak sets and enrichment tracks
    as easy as possible at all stages.  This assumes you have a set of bed-like files 
    representing areas of enrichment (peaks) or other biologically relevant regions 
    (promoters, enhancers) and bigwigs representing enrichment for the same samples 
    or other relevant samples.
