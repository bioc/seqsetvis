Description: seqsetvis makes the visualization and analysis of ChIP-seq peak sets and 
    enrichment tracks as easy as possible at all stages.  This assumes you have 
    a set of bed-like files representing areas of enrichment (peaks) or other 
    biologically relevant regions (promoters, enhancers) and bigwigs 
    representing enrichment for the same samples or other relevant samples.
    This package makes heavy use of the data.table and ggplot2 packages and should
    be straightforward to understand and highly customizable if users are familiar 
    with these packages. If not, it should also "just work" and familiarity with 
    these packages is not required.
